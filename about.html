    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      CarePath Atlas is a student-led initiative focused on improving
      teen health literacy by teaching clinical reasoning —
      how doctors think, not what to self-diagnose.
    </p>

    <h2>Ethical Design</h2>
    <p>
      This project does not provide medical diagnoses.
      All educational content is reviewed for safety,
      and any collected data is anonymized and optional.
    </p>

    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <p>
      We welcome students, educators, developers, and health professionals
      who want to contribute to ethical health education and research.
